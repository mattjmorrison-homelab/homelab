# Homelab Docs

This homelab runs a k3s Kubernetes cluster across several machines, all managed as code. NixOS configures the hosts, ArgoCD manages all deployments, and each service lives in its own repo.

## Architecture

```
NixOS (homelab) → k3s cluster → ArgoCD (homelab-argocd) → services (homelab-apps → homelab-*)
```

Secrets flow: OpenBao stores secrets → External Secrets Operator syncs them into Kubernetes Secrets → apps consume them.
